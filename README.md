# Moodle-Cartridges
This repo contains a collection of Moodle Cartridges. A Cartridge is a collection of a ready to use Moodle materials packaged as a backup of a Moodle course. You can import this mbz into your Moodle as a separate course by restoring the .mbz.  Then you can use materials in it  by importing one or more  items from the course created by restoring the cartridge.  

Each cartridge contain quizzes and activities with self evaluation.
Some quizzes involves activities that has been developed using Geogebra. Hence they need a [special version of Geogebra question type](https://github.com/TWINGSISTER/moodle-qtype_geogebra). Furthermore these activities work well with [this plugin for live report](https://github.com/TWINGSISTER/moodle-quiz_liveviewgrid).
 
Included in the backup there are also documents, usually PDFs, about the theory needed to answer the quizzes, these are in Italian.

At the beginninig of each cartridge there are also dummy collections of tests that suggest some useful skeletons that could be instantiated to create meaningful collection of questions. 

These skeletons had been used to create the shipped tests.
  
Most of the materials are adaptions of open source materials and original sources are quoted in the main menu of the course once restored.
